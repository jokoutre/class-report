        <p><strong>General Remarks:</strong> Faith often returns workbooks with covers and pages torn or stained. There is a habit of scribbling instead of taking the work seriously. Faith also does not seem to keep or utilize learning materials, such as booklets and topic organizers. Please ensure Faith is responsible for her learning materials and uses them for practice.</p>
